			Scott Sampson </h2>

			<p>
			What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the 
			Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the 
			Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the 
			ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number 
			of countries in Africa.

			Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the 
			University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned 
			dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid 
			horns and frills.

			Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural 
			History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New 
			York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah 
			accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics 
			and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research 
			interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of 
			Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.

			In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
			work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
			also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, 
			Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most 
			comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
